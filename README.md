## Usage Instructions

### Selecting a problem to work on

Once the workshop is installed, run functional-javascript-workshop to print a menu where you can select a problem to work on.

`functional-javascript-workshop`

Problems are listed in rough order of difficulty. You are advised to complete them in order, as later problems will build on skills developed by solving previous problems.

### Writing your solution

Once you have selected a problem, the workshop will remember which problem you are working on. Using your preferred editor, simply create a file to write your solution in. Most problems will supply some boilerplate with which to get started. Copy this from the problem description to your solution file.

### Testing your solution

Use the workshop's run command to point the workshop at your solution file. Your solution will loaded and passed the problem input. This usually won't perform any validation, it will only show the program output.

`functional-javascript-workshop run mysolution.js`


### Verifying your solution

Your solution will be verified against the output of the 'official' solution. If all of the output matches, then you have successfully solved the problem!

`functional-javascript-workshop verify mysolution.js`
